AS3340 is a voltage-controlled oscillator. This board is made with the specs specified in the datasheet of the AS3340, which can be found [here](https://www.alfarzpp.lv/eng/sc/AS3340.pdf).

I also included a 555-based negative voltage generator for this circuit, as the board specifies a need for it. Vcc is rated at 15V, and Vee is approximately -13V.
